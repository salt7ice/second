Alice has a cake, and she is going to cut it. She will perform the following operation 𝑛−1 times: choose a piece of the cake (initially, the cake is all one piece) with weight 𝑤≥2 and cut it into two smaller pieces of weight ⌊𝑤2⌋ and ⌈𝑤2⌉ (⌊𝑥⌋ and ⌈𝑥⌉ denote floor and ceiling functions, respectively).

After cutting the cake in 𝑛 pieces, she will line up these 𝑛 pieces on a table in an arbitrary order. Let 𝑎𝑖 be the weight of the 𝑖-th piece in the line.

You are given the array 𝑎. Determine whether there exists an initial weight and sequence of operations which results in 𝑎.
